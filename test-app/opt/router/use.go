// Adding CORS here would cause duplicate headers when requests are proxied.
//
// IMPORTANT: IDsMiddleware and LoggerMiddleware are registered GLOBALLY on
// `app` rather than on a local `/api/v1` group. The previous implementation
// created a local group variable that was discarded, while each service's
// SetupXxxRoutes function created its OWN `e.Group("/api/v1")` for routes,
// leaving the routes without any of this middleware. Making these global
// ensures every request gets an ID and is logged regardless of which group
// the routes end up on.
